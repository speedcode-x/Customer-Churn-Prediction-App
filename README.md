# Customer-Churn-Prediction-App
This repository is focused on developing a user-friendly customer churn prediction app using Streamlit for embedding ML models. Enables non-technical stakeholders to utilize models effortlessly. Repository includes preprocessing, model training scripts, and Streamlit setup for easy deployment.

Customer Churn Prediction App
Overview
This Streamlit web application aims to provide insights and predictions related to customer churn. It utilizes various data visualization techniques and machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides visualizations to explore the dataset and understand the underlying patterns.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays important metrics such as churn rate, average total charges, etc.
Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning models to predict customer churn based on input features.
Interactive Dashboard: Allows users to interact with the data and explore different visualizations.
